# Harry-potter's invisible cloak

1. Install 3 libraries by running the below commands before you use this code:
            a. pip install numpy 
            b. pip install time
            c. pip install opencv-python
            
2. Run the file and as soon as the video output window opens, wait for a few seconds to test it as it takes few seconds to load the background.
3. I have hard coded the boundary values for red color. You can change those values to anycolor that you want.
4. Use you cloth and have fun using this code.
